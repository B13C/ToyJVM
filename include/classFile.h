/*
Returns 1 if the class file passes the test. Anything else if not.

1-The first four bytes must contain the right magic number.+
2-All recognized attributes must be of the proper length.?
3-The class file must not be truncated or have extra bytes at the end.-
4-The constant pool must satisfy the constraints documented throughout ยง4.4.?
For example, each CONSTANT_Class_info structure in the constant pool 
must contain in its name_index item a valid constant pool index for a CONSTANT_Utf8_info structure.
6-All field references and method references in the constant pool must 
have valid names, valid classes, and valid descriptors (ยง4.3).
7-Format checking does not ensure that the given field or method actually 
exists in the given class, nor that the descriptors given refer to real classes. 
Format checking ensures only that these items are well formed. More detailed 
checking is performed when the bytecodes themselves are verified, and during resolution.
