# ToyJVM

Experimental Java Bytecode Interpreter written in C to understand Java concepts better.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites


```Javac``` is required to compile Java codes into Java bytecodes.

## Running the tests

You can run the tests with the ```test.sh``` script. As the project grows up, new tests will be added.

## Running the software

You need to give the class name without extension to the executable. For example ```./bin/main test/HelloWorld``` will run the test/HelloWorld.class file.
